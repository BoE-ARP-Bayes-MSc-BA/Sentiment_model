Hi,Andrew Ritchie,unknown
"Good morning, everyone",Andrew Ritchie,unknown
"Could I just dig in a little bit more to the increased catbudget for 2022, the EUR1.3 billion",Andrew Ritchie,past
"Because you split that between man-made andNatCat, because I noticed you give that split now, you gave us split for '21",Andrew Ritchie,past
"I guess I'm justcurious that the budget is growing 18%, is that a proxy then for your expected NEP growthor is it growing just funding ahead of NEP growth? I'm just trying to frame when you talkabout it growing in line with business, to what degree it really is just the business volumeversus anything else going on?My only other question was, on the longevity release, thanks for the additional color",Andrew Ritchie,past
"I'mjust trying to judge, would there be like another possibly two years or something, beforewe'd have mortality, before you got more information again from cedents to updateagain unreleased further PADs",Andrew Ritchie,past
"If there's something, it could be that much of a gapbetween when you look at it again, because of the nature of the slow information flowfrom cedents",Andrew Ritchie,present
Thanks.Jean-Jacques HenchozThank you,Andrew Ritchie,unknown
"So, first question, Sven on the NatCat budgeting, and Klaus will address thelongevity release.Sven AlthoffYes",Andrew Ritchie,past
"With regard to the major loss budget, happy to give you the split man-made versusNatCat",Andrew Ritchie,unknown
"So, we kept the relative percentage just close to the distribution we had in 2021.So, it's roughly 80-20 and to be precise, EUR250 million out of the EUR1.3 billion is manmade and EUR1.050 billion is the natural catastrophe",Andrew Ritchie,past
The growth is not a proxy for ourpremium growth ambitions for next year,Andrew Ritchie,past
"As always, it is the mix between the growth wehave seen already this year and there is a natural time lag translating this into our majorloss budget and the development of the major loss budget, and some of the anticipatedgrowth we expect for next year.The bulk of the increase on the NatCat side is growth related",Andrew Ritchie,past
"There's only a smallerportion going to model changes, which we are doing on an annual basis, where we arevalidating our current modeling assumptions and given the losses over the last three tofour years, of course, there are always some minor changes even there and some of thatis flowing through into the major loss budget increase for 2022.Klaus MillerOkay",Andrew Ritchie,past
"Now, I'm happy to take the question on the longevity side",Andrew Ritchie,past
The way how it works aswe -- our counterparties are either pension funds or in some cases life and pensioninsurer,Andrew Ritchie,past
"And especially, the pension funds, how do I say that tactfully, I'm not at theforefront of modern admin systems and they are not used to do reinsurance accounting.So, when they take out this reinsurance, it's probably the first and only time they do thatand they have to change their systems to administer that",Andrew Ritchie,past
"And that takes usually at least ayear, sometimes two, sometimes even more.We have grown a lot in the last couple of years and got an awful lot of these (inaudible)and we did the pricing and when the treaty was concluded, it was also agreed that we getat least annual update",Andrew Ritchie,past
"Sometimes we get these, sometimes we didn't, sometimes wehave to ask for it",Andrew Ritchie,past
"So, a delay of two years is probably the norm.And when we get these updates, of course, we get accounts, but we only see the fixedlag, which is fixed from the outset",Andrew Ritchie,past
We know exactly these numbers,Andrew Ritchie,past
They don't even haveto send it to us,Andrew Ritchie,past
"And we see the variable lag, the monthly, quarterly pensions we have topay",Andrew Ritchie,past
"And as long as we see that, the fixed lag is higher than the variable lag",Andrew Ritchie,past
We know thatthe treaty is basically going according to plan,Andrew Ritchie,past
"And then, we just book these numbers.What we get as additional information from the (inaudible) is, are there people who died,if they are younger in terms of the annual monthly pension, it might be the same assomebody of aged 60 gets GBP1,000, or of aged 90 gets GBP1,000",Andrew Ritchie,past
"So, in the monthlyaccounts, you don't see a difference",Andrew Ritchie,past
"But if somebody who is 60 dies, and we had a lot ofthese claims more than expected, then the impact on the profitability is much higher thanif somebody at the age of 90 dies, because the remaining pension time would be much,much shorter.And we try to be assured with these (inaudible) but due to some other work, especiallywriting new business or people were not completely up to date with the analysis of the(inaudible) we received and then we took a major asset last year to start getting this up todate and again this year",Andrew Ritchie,past
And you can expect this for the future,Andrew Ritchie,past
"If we don't update the(inaudible) and release the PADs as Clemens mentioned earlier, you should expect ourprofits are improving from year-to-year in small -- very small set",Andrew Ritchie,past
"And then only as soon aswe take the (inaudible) and clean up for the people who have died more than expected.And obviously, we can release all the provisions for adverse deviations for these deadpeople because we definitely don't need it",Andrew Ritchie,past
Then you will see a big profit like you see thisyear,Andrew Ritchie,past
This should happen regularly every two or three years.Jean-Jacques HenchozYes,Andrew Ritchie,past
"Andrew, if I may add, you shouldn't see that as a recurring result (inaudible)Sure.Jean-Jacques Henchoz-- this year, so it's really, as Klaus mentioned, it's a bit of the cleanup to be honest",Andrew Ritchie,present
"So,there will be an effect in every year going forward, but certainly not to that amount thatwe've seen this year.Klaus MillerBut just to make one point clear, this is not a new assumption setting for mortality in thefuture",Andrew Ritchie,past
This is cleaning up the portfolio for people who have died,Andrew Ritchie,past
"And therefore, clearly,we don't need to pass any long term.Great",Andrew Ritchie,past
Thanks very much,Andrew Ritchie,unknown
"Thank you.Jean-Jacques HenchozThank you.OperatorThe next question is from Vinit Malhotra, Mediobanca",Andrew Ritchie,past
Your line is now open,Andrew Ritchie,past
Please goahead.,Andrew Ritchie,unknown
"Hey, good morning",Vinit Malhotra,unknown
Thank you very much,Vinit Malhotra,unknown
"So, a few questions please if I can",Vinit Malhotra,past
"First is that,I'm noticing, I mean, you're talking about Solvency FTR growth, but I can't seem torecollect that, it was there, for example, similar period last year, might have been, but wedidn't really mention it",Vinit Malhotra,past
The growth was similar,Vinit Malhotra,past
"So, I just wanted to know, is there anythingmore remarkable in that number? And this is more a quick check really.Second question is on the combined ratios in credit",Vinit Malhotra,past
I think I can back calculate 3Q is about73%,Vinit Malhotra,present
"Now, remember that we keep talking about how the economic recovery andinsolvency in state schemes going away",Vinit Malhotra,past
Is there any reserve movement here or anythingmore notable please?Just one more question on retro please,Vinit Malhotra,past
"The bond recovery is very, very high",Vinit Malhotra,past
"I mean 240net growth, 643, I think is one of the very strong recoveries for a single loss",Vinit Malhotra,past
"Could youcomment on that? With also some comments please on Texas freeze?And just lastly, please, the cash flow of EUR1.5 billion is very, very high, very high as far asme",Vinit Malhotra,past
"You mentioned investment income, the roads and the business, but is there anythingmore remarkable, for instance, I mean, there would also be payouts to be made on theseEUR1 billion plus of losses",Vinit Malhotra,past
"Would that be affecting cash flows in the future as well? So, Ijust wanted to understand the cash flow well? Thank you very much.Jean-Jacques HenchozThank you, Vinit",Vinit Malhotra,unknown
"So (Technical Difficulty) and cash flow, Clemens will give you status andcredit (Technical Difficulty) and large losses, Sven will comment on this.Clemens Jungsthof elYes, Vinit",Vinit Malhotra,past
Good morning,Vinit Malhotra,unknown
Let's start with the Solvency I,Vinit Malhotra,unknown
"So, it's really as Jean-Jacquesmentioned, the SCR increase, our own funds have largely not moved at all",Vinit Malhotra,past
"So, if wewould be looking at, let's say, as stable as the Solvency II ratio would mainly be on thebasis of Q2 of 250 roughly",Vinit Malhotra,past
"So, it's really the SCR that increased heavily",Vinit Malhotra,past
"It's the usualexercise that we do in Q3.First of all, it's a reflection as Jean-Jacques mentioned on the current business growththat we've seen in this year",Vinit Malhotra,past
"But also, regularly in Q3, when we do our planning cycle forthe next year, we include in our SCR model, in our internal model, the expected newbusiness both in P&C and in life and health, in our SCR calculation, and that's the reasonwhy the -- that's the main driver of the decrease in the Solvency II ratio",Vinit Malhotra,past
"Again, it's theusual exercise, I'm just looking at the Q3 numbers for the last couple of years as wespeak, Vinit, and it's always been the case that we have seen a dip in Q3 actually.And I would expect with their own funds and looking at our reserving position, et cetera, inQ4, I would expect that, that number to increase again in Q4",Vinit Malhotra,past
"What is probably also worthmentioning is the slight reallocation in our assets portfolio and our investment more to abit more alternative investments, et cetera",Vinit Malhotra,past
I think that has also contributed to an SCRincrease,Vinit Malhotra,past
"But again, I think that will -- when we look at our reserving, when we look at ournew business from an own funds perspective, we will be reflecting that in Q4, and then inthe next quarter.Yeah",Vinit Malhotra,present
"Thank you.Sven AlthoffThe credit and surety combined ratio, what you are seeing here is the impact of positiverunoff from old underwriting years",Vinit Malhotra,past
"We are still reserving the underwriting years at higherthan-average combined ratios due to the uncertainty, that what will happen to the level ofinsolvencies once the various economic stimulus packages are phasing out, but the runofffor the older underwriting years is positive, more positive than expected, given that wenow had a period of one-and-a-half to two years of economic stimulus",Vinit Malhotra,past
"So, the short-termlevel of insolvencies were below our original assumptions.And there's a tail on trade credit is not particularly long",Vinit Malhotra,past
"So, three to five years, we couldnow release some ultimate loss ratios from those prior underwriting years.When it comes to the burnt loss, you're right, the difference between the gross and thenet is relatively high",Vinit Malhotra,past
"This means that we could collect the burnt losses from both ourtransactions, but also particularly from other -- our whole account protections, whichexplains the difference between the two numbers, Hurricane Ida on the other hand, thebulk of the difference between gross and net, which you are seeing is actually thedifference coming from the ILS business, which we are fronting",Vinit Malhotra,present
"So, EUR180 million out ofthat gap is coming from our fronting activities",Vinit Malhotra,past
"So, on Ida, we had -- we have booked Krecoveries, but no further excess of lost recoveries to walk our net position",Vinit Malhotra,past
"And on thewinter storm in the United States, we unfortunately had another round of negative runoffin the third quarter, which is due to the very late reporting from ceding companies on thatfreeze loss",Vinit Malhotra,past
"So, this was a little unexpected, but given the situation with lot adjusting andcapacity for construction in the U.S., the reporting is slower compared to the usualreporting periods",Vinit Malhotra,past
"We are used to, but we are under the assumption now that we shouldhave seen the full impact of winter storm Uri with this third quarter figures.Okay",Vinit Malhotra,past
"Thanks, Sven.OperatorThe next question is from William Hardcastle, UBS",Vinit Malhotra,past
Your line is now open,Vinit Malhotra,past
Please goahead.Yes,Vinit Malhotra,unknown
Thank you for the opportunity,Vinit Malhotra,unknown
"Sorry to ask again, but on the life side, I mean, I'm justcurious about a few things please.One is that, if I just start with the operated -- the reported EBIT of EUR41 million, and addback COVID mortality data, the longevity is at EUR83 million",Vinit Malhotra,past
"And then somewhere fromthe presentation, I picked up that financials -- the deposit accounting was also EUR95million",Vinit Malhotra,past
"So, ex deposit accounting, we actually have a loss of about EUR12 million",Vinit Malhotra,past
And I'vebeen made aware that there are some derivatives which went up against in the financial -in the financial statement,Vinit Malhotra,past
"I mean, is there anything that you could comment on thissurprisingly negative result on the life side, please? That's really my question.And second question is, on this cover on the pandemic, I think there was a conversationalso in the 2Q results, where it was mentioned that the cover wasn't being activated yet,because of Australian mortality trends, if I recollect",Vinit Malhotra,past
"Has that changed? Or is there someupdate on that, that makes you think that next year you could choose this cover?And last follow-up is on getting a question from (inaudible) is there any idea to break outthis burned between (inaudible) and the whole account, please? Thank you.Clemens Jungsthof elOkay",Vinit Malhotra,past
The first question was the EBIT,Vinit Malhotra,past
"I fully understand that you do a little bit of, let's say,recalculation, take a few things out and add others back in, but the COVID reporting ofCOVID claims is, let's say, at least very delayed, if not completely unreliable",Vinit Malhotra,past
"So, makingcalculations especially on the quarterly basis, what the usual number would be, it's quitedifficult",Vinit Malhotra,past
"We don't get correct information from all our clients, and we definitely don't get itin time",Vinit Malhotra,past
"So, adding or subtracting COVID claims from, let's say, audited claims numbers is-- it's a nice intellectual exercise, but I would not necessarily rely on the outcome here.I can't see that we have a negative -- of course, we have a negative results if you look atthe COVID claims on mortality side, it's highly negative, but we have a very stable financialsolutions result",Vinit Malhotra,present
"What you have seen in the other result here is the 351, of which 278 isdeposit accounting treaties and they are completely unaffected by COVID",Vinit Malhotra,past
"We also havevery positive longevity result, plus even if you ignore the one-off of nearly EUR100 million,which is also only slightly positive impacted by COVID",Vinit Malhotra,past
"And the EUR400 million COVIDclaims, of course, drag it down, but the underlying profitability is extremely high andstable",Vinit Malhotra,past
The great unknown for us is how the next COVID variant will develop in '22,Vinit Malhotra,past
"Andnobody can tell you anything about that.Jean-Jacques HenchozVinit, to briefly add probably, it just brings to my mind, what is the driver, and which mightexplain what you have observed is in part what Klaus mentioned the profitability of theunderlying business, but has probably been a bit more pronounced in the first and thesecond quarter and less in the third quarter",Vinit Malhotra,past
"But then on top of that, I think the investmentresult on the life and health side is less pronounced than on the P&C side, that's mainlyattributable to the fact that alternative investments are mainly sitting within our P&C book.And also, the contribution from inflation linker is mainly P&C",Vinit Malhotra,past
"And then, we have thementioned derivative in the U.K",Vinit Malhotra,past
results and that is -- that was a deviation in the thirdquarter of roughly EUR10 million,Vinit Malhotra,past
"So overall, that should round up the picture probably.Clemens Jungsthof elBut definitely the COVID -- the reported COVID claims, not necessarily booked claims,but as COVID -- or the identified COVID claims have reporting lag of four to six weeksand even then they are not necessarily reliable, because an awful lot of people,everybody who gets into a hospital, gets tested on COVID, and if it's positive, even if thathas nothing to do with the fact that, he just had a car accident and if he dies, he will bereported as a COVID claim in many countries",Vinit Malhotra,past
That doesn't happen,Vinit Malhotra,past
So I don't really relyon this analysis,Vinit Malhotra,past
Definitely not on a quarterly basis,Vinit Malhotra,unknown
"And then, could you just repeat yourquestion on the retro whether we have included that already in 2021?As the life pandemic cover was already running at a higher and I think at 2Q, you had saidthat you were not yet counting it in or factoring it because of Australian mortality claims.Maybe I'm misunderstanding the whole thing",Vinit Malhotra,past
But maybe -- yes.Clemens Jungsthof elThe cover is for all three countries in total,Vinit Malhotra,past
"So, it's a parametric cover and this stands at100 and close to 113 right now",Vinit Malhotra,past
"If nobody dies for the rest of the year, this will fall belowthe 110 and we don't get anything",Vinit Malhotra,present
It's unlikely that we don't even see normal mortality,Vinit Malhotra,past
"So,I expect definitely something in -- for this year, but it will only be calculated next year,because the calculation agent relies on official statistics and official statistics, populationstatistics for 2021 will only be available sometime in 2022",Vinit Malhotra,past
"And sometimes it's not Januaryor February or anything like that, well the second half of the year",Vinit Malhotra,past
"These are civil servantswho produce that.And the calculation agent will only start calculating the final recuperation for us here, assoon as he has all the official statistics from the U.S., from Australia, from the U.K.And the EUR32 million booked in the U.S",Vinit Malhotra,past
"COVID 3Q, that looked a bit lower and thatcould be also this late supporting, Klaus, that you mentioned?That in the third quarter, the U.S",Vinit Malhotra,past
"was rather low mortality in booking of EUR32 millionversus the deaths and the excess straight were nearly EUR100,000.Clemens Jungsthof elVinit, sorry, I think -- apologies, Vinit",Vinit Malhotra,past
"Go ahead.Jean-Jacques HenchozI think the effect in Q3, the overall effect in Q3 was EUR140 million, EUR70 million toEUR80 million stemming out of South Africa",Vinit Malhotra,past
So that was the bulk,Vinit Malhotra,past
"And I think, it's probablya bit higher number than you assume for the U.S",Vinit Malhotra,past
"actually, but that was as expected, Klaus,wasn't it in life and health in the U.S.Okay",Vinit Malhotra,past
Thank you very much,Vinit Malhotra,unknown
Thank you.Klaus MillerYes,Vinit Malhotra,unknown
"On burned, Vinit, you know that we have placed a little over EUR300 million of wholeaccounts coverage",Vinit Malhotra,past
"So, you should think about burned in the terms of being a substantialpartial loss against our whole account cover",Vinit Malhotra,unknown
"I would not be comfortable to give you theprecise split for the simple reason that the loss happened in the quarter.So therefore, we have not received enough information yet to book each and everyelement of the loss on the bottom-up basis",Vinit Malhotra,past
"So, there are still some top-downassumptions included in our gross number for burned",Vinit Malhotra,past
"And depending on how that will fallin the end on individual contracts, the split between K and whole account is subject tochange",Vinit Malhotra,present
"So, whatever (inaudible) split, I would give you today, would be subject to thatchange",Vinit Malhotra,past
"So therefore, I would feel uncomfortable to giving you very precise numbers",Vinit Malhotra,past
"Butas I said, you should think about burned as a substantial partial loss against our wholeaccount structure with the remainder going to K.Thank you very much",Vinit Malhotra,past
Appreciate it,Vinit Malhotra,unknown
"Thank you.Operator(Operator Instructions) And we do have a follow-up from Thomas Fossard, HSBC",Vinit Malhotra,past
Yourline is now open again.,Vinit Malhotra,past
"On the cash flow, nothing really significant",Unidentified Speaker,unknown
"I mean, Jean-Jacques mentioned, for example,the Q1 effects from Voya and, of course, the bond issuance, et cetera, but in Q3, it's reallythe business in flow",Unidentified Speaker,past
"And I think what is probably worth mentioning here, when it is the factthat we have seen very low payout ratios when it comes to our plane",Unidentified Speaker,past
"I think that'sprobably the main driver, that the cash outflows for large losses has been lower than Iwould have expected",Unidentified Speaker,past
"I hope that answers the questions, Vinit.On COVID, life and health, William, I think your assumption is right",Unidentified Speaker,past
We have built in someexpectation in our 2022 guidance for COVID related claims,Unidentified Speaker,past
It's not going to be a tripledigit number,Unidentified Speaker,past
It's somewhere a double-digit number I think that we've baked in,Unidentified Speaker,past
"On top ofthat though, we still have the potential coverage from our retro pandemic cover in life andhealth, that will be most likely paid out in 2022",Unidentified Speaker,unknown
"So, that will give us an additional buffer forthe year",Unidentified Speaker,past
"But as Jean-Jacques mentioned, it shouldn't -- should not significantly deviatefrom those numbers.Just for clarity, when the coverage is, it's a parametric trigger and the coverage is U.S.,Australia, and U.K",Unidentified Speaker,present
"So, it's not South Africa.Sorry --",Unidentified Speaker,past
"Hi, morning, everyone",William Hardcastle,unknown
Just a quick follow-up on that,William Hardcastle,unknown
"So, essentially on the frontingbusiness, is what you're saying the difference between the gross and net, obviously onthe floods is bigger versus Ida",William Hardcastle,past
Is that because of the greater fronting on Europeanbusiness? Is that what you're saying?Klaus MillerNo,William Hardcastle,past
Not at all,William Hardcastle,unknown
That's not what I was saying or trying to say at least,William Hardcastle,past
"When it comes to theGerman business, we hardly do any fronting",William Hardcastle,past
"So, the difference on burnt between grossand net, is really our own retro sessions",William Hardcastle,past
"So, the gross number you are seeing is alsoalmost exclusively our own writing",William Hardcastle,past
that situation is different on an Ida,William Hardcastle,past
The U.S,William Hardcastle,unknown
portfolio isthe peak portfolio in our fronting activities,William Hardcastle,unknown
"So, therefore out of the EUR527 million ofgross, approximately EUR180 million is fronted business, where -- while on burnt, it isalmost zero.Sure",William Hardcastle,past
It's quite the opposite of what I was saying,William Hardcastle,past
"So, effectively your retro is kicking farstronger in your own account from the floods than has on Ida",William Hardcastle,past
"Is there anything why that'shappened? Is there a specific reason?Jean-Jacques HenchozWell, it's a question of market share",William Hardcastle,past
"Given that our subsidiary for the German business,the ENS, from a market share perspective, the market leader in the German business",William Hardcastle,past
"Ourmarket share in Germany is just much, much higher on the business in general, but alsothe NatCat component within the business compared to where we are in the UnitedStates, where our market share on cat-related business is underweight.Okay",William Hardcastle,past
Moving to (inaudible) I'll go to my actual questions now,William Hardcastle,past
"What benefit did thereinstatement premium have in Q3 for P&C? And is this already factored in when youprovide the 2022 outlook, to say greater than 5%? And perhaps any quantification of whatthat impact is?And the second one is, you've touched on there on the 2022 guidance, no materialCOVID-19 impact in life and health",William Hardcastle,past
"Just for clarity, it sounds like you're not assuming zero,but certainly less than something like EUR100 million",William Hardcastle,past
Is that a very fair assumption?Jean-Jacques HenchozYes,William Hardcastle,past
"On the reinstatement premium, we be -- our immediately booking thosereinstatement premiums when we are booking the losses, so there is no spillover effectinto 2022 from reinstatement premiums",William Hardcastle,past
I don't have any precise numbers for you on howhigh exactly those reinstatement premiums which we have booked in Q3 were,William Hardcastle,past
"So, ratherthan speculating, I guess we will have to come back to you on that.And just on that pandemic retro cover, it sounds like you feel very confident that will payout now, is that because Q3 losses for excess mortality came in ahead of yourexpectation, that it's effectively giving greater certainty that it will kick in",William Hardcastle,present
Is that how weshould read that?Jean-Jacques HenchozYes,William Hardcastle,past
That's absolutely correct,William Hardcastle,past
"Currently, the ratio stands at about 113% according to ourown calculation",William Hardcastle,past
"From a formal point of view, there will be a calculation agent who will dothe calculation, as soon as he gets the official statistics for the years 2020 and 2021",William Hardcastle,future
Sothat will take some time in 2022 before this information is available,William Hardcastle,past
"But according to ourown calculation, we are getting close to 113% now.Brilliant",William Hardcastle,past
"Thank you.OperatorThe next question is from Thomas Fossard, HSBC",William Hardcastle,past
Your line is now open,William Hardcastle,past
Please goahead.,William Hardcastle,unknown
Yes,Thomas Fossard,unknown
Good morning,Thomas Fossard,unknown
Couple of questions,Thomas Fossard,unknown
The first one would be related to the walk fromthe '22 guidance versus 2021,Thomas Fossard,past
"If you could add maybe a bit of color on the underlyingassumptions you have taken? The second quick question will be, regarding COVIDscenario for 2022, I guess that you built something in into your 239% Solvency II ratioalready, given it's forward-looking in terms of calculation",Thomas Fossard,past
"So, would you mind sayingmaybe a range of what you're already expecting for 2022?And so, the last question would be, just to come back on the 2.3% return on investmentguidance for 2022, and especially knowing that you reported 2.9% or 2.8% ordinaryinvestment income in 2021",Thomas Fossard,present
"I mean, you've got the support from private equity frominflation linkers, but I'm wondering either 2.3% should be -- if nothing exceptionally is inthe reported nine months 2021, I'm wondering, is the 2.3% should be compared to the2.4% 2020 guidance or to the 2.8% 2021, and 2.3% seems to be super, super cautious,given what you achieved this year",Thomas Fossard,past
Thank you.Clemens Jungsthof elYes,Thomas Fossard,past
"Thomas, let's probably start with the guidance for 2022",Thomas Fossard,unknown
"So, overall, I think withoutgoing too much into the details, the core question is, where does the increase in netincome mainly stem from",Thomas Fossard,past
It's clearly a mix of effect,Thomas Fossard,past
"In the bottom line, first of all, ofcourse, the significant business growth that we've seen both in P&C -- in life and healthand in P&C, the quality of the book should have increased over the last couple of years.So, we will certainly increase -- we'll see an increase of profitability and in P&C here andthere",Thomas Fossard,past
"And of course, the overall amount of the growth will be reflected in higher EBITnumbers in P&C",Thomas Fossard,past
"On the life and health book, as mentioned earlier, the expectation is thatwe will see significant less COVID-19 claims in the life and health segment",Thomas Fossard,unknown
"So, theunderlying profitability of the business should come through in 2022",Thomas Fossard,past
"That will be anotherlarge contributor.On the investment side, I think, yes, when you look at the numbers, they do seem verycautious for 2022",Thomas Fossard,present
"We are optimistic that we will at least reach that number, the 2.3%, butI'm just conscious of the fact, of course, that we've seen sort of a rebound in thecontribution from alternative investment, that amount has been significant",Thomas Fossard,past
"I think roughlyEUR100 million of our ordinary income is only related to an increase compared to last yearof the contribution of alternative investments, mainly private equity",Thomas Fossard,past
"So, I wouldn't reallyfactor that in going forward for every year",Thomas Fossard,past
"I think that did come a bit as a surprise for me,to be honest, also the valuations on the private equity side, which have increasedsignificantly",Thomas Fossard,past
"So, I wouldn't really want to expect that amount for 2022.Inflation-linked bonds, the same picture there",Thomas Fossard,past
"We have seen a huge contribution,probably EUR100 million more this year as well, compared to last year, given the currentinflation environment and the way the amortization of our inflation-linked bonds work",Thomas Fossard,past
"So,there are two -- at least two effects in the ordinary already, that we will see to someextent in next year, but we have been a bit more cautious on that end.On Solvency II, if I got the question right, Thomas, but please add",Thomas Fossard,past
"So, how much from theSCR increase would we attribute to our growth in 2022? I don't have the exact number.But I think overall, it's certainly on the Solvency II ratio, probably a double digit -- lowdouble-digit number, or a high single-digit, a low double-digit number that is attributableto that effect",Thomas Fossard,present
But again --Yes,Thomas Fossard,unknown
"I think, Clemens, I was more thinking about the prospective COVID-19 mortalitylosses that you are expecting to incur in 2022, which may already be reflected into yourSolvency II ratio at Q3.Clemens Jungsthof elYes",Thomas Fossard,past
"No, that is not -- I don't think that is included in the SCR and in the own funds yet",Thomas Fossard,past
"Wewill do an update of that planning and the effect I think in the fourth quarter, but it's notreflected",Thomas Fossard,past
"But it wouldn't be in a substantial amount as mentioned earlier anyways.Yes.Jean-Jacques HenchozSorry, Thomas.OperatorThe next question is from Iain Pearce, Credit Suisse",Thomas Fossard,unknown
Your line is now open,Thomas Fossard,past
Please goahead.Yes,Thomas Fossard,unknown
Two quick questions,Thomas Fossard,unknown
"The first one would be on the life reside, this longevity PAD",Thomas Fossard,past
"Iguess it was included in your EUR600 million EBIT contribution initially targeted for 2023and that you move to 2024, but just wanted to -- I guess it was included at the time of theInvestor Day",Thomas Fossard,past
"But just wanted to update on that, just to be fully aligned and fully clear",Thomas Fossard,past
Andthe second question would be on the P&C side or P&C NatCat,Thomas Fossard,past
What's your overallassessment of the profitability of your book? Maybe you could share with us the year-todate combined ratio or the return on allocated capital you're getting on this book despiterunning ahead of budget? Thank you.Clemens Jungsthof elYes,Thomas Fossard,past
"Thomas, this is indeed taking into account the longevity and benefits also that -that's including the EUR600 million.Klaus MillerAnd on the NatCat, so as Jean-Jacques explained in the Q&A, during the Investors Day, ofthe NatCat portfolio is modeling well against our profitability hurdle rate",Thomas Fossard,past
"So, from pricingpoint of view, the last two rounds of rate increases certainly helped to get that portfolio toa better level of profitability",Thomas Fossard,past
We expect further rate increases on the loss impactedbusiness into 2022,Thomas Fossard,past
"So, from that point of view, we are okay with our profitability on theNatCat side, but at the same time, as we already mentioned on the Investors Day, we willkeep our relative risk appetite for NatCat stable nonetheless",Thomas Fossard,past
"We are not seeing ratesyet, which would make us fundamentally change our risk appetite.On the result point of view, I'm afraid, I don't have those numbers for you",Thomas Fossard,present
"The NatCat isnot a separate segment we are reporting upon, as you know, for few quarters now",Thomas Fossard,past
"So, Iwould not be able to give you those numbers, but Claude can get back to you on those.Thank you",Thomas Fossard,past
Thank you.OperatorAnd there are no further questions at this point,Thomas Fossard,past
"So, I hand back to the speakers forclosing remarks.Jean-Jacques HenchozWell, thank you very much for joining, and thank you for the great questions",Thomas Fossard,past
I think wecovered the ground very well,Thomas Fossard,past
"You've seen a year impacted by large losses on bothbusiness segments that numbers demonstrating resilience, net income improved, theROE above 10%",Thomas Fossard,past
And I think the key message is that the profit guidance has beenconfirmed for this year with a positive outlook for 2022,Thomas Fossard,past
The guidance for '22 shows boththe growth trajectory of the company and the improved quality of the book,Thomas Fossard,past
"So, I think thekey messages were addressed today",Thomas Fossard,past
"Thank you very much for all the questions and seeyou next time.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thank you for your attendance",Thomas Fossard,unknown
This call has been concluded,Thomas Fossard,past
Youmay disconnect.,Thomas Fossard,unknown
Hi,Iain Pearce,unknown
Thanks for taking my questions,Iain Pearce,past
The first one is just on the growth numbers,Iain Pearce,past
"When welook at the impact on the Solvency II ratio and the increase in the cat budget, theimplication is probably that growth is going to be significantly ahead of 5% especially inP&C rates",Iain Pearce,past
"So firstly, do you think that's a fair assumption?And then secondly, is there anything in terms of life and health growth that you're thinkingis going to be lower, that's leading you to maintain that 5% growth target? The secondone was just a quick clarification, the life retro kicks in, is it a 100% excess of normalmortality that the trigger for that parametric cover?And then, the third one was just on longevity releases and the potential for these goingforward",Iain Pearce,past
"Sort of -- you sort of cautioned us against factoring in too much here, but if youthink -- if I thinking in sort of your key longevity markets, mortality has been trendingfavorably consistently over the last couple of years before we even factor in any impactsfrom COVID",Iain Pearce,past
Why should we not be thinking that these are going to be some -- there'sgoing to be continued favorable longevity development?Jean-Jacques HenchozThank you,Iain Pearce,past
"So, Klaus, maybe you can address the life and health point and the growth inP&C, Sven you can add there again.Klaus MillerOkay",Iain Pearce,past
Let's start with the growth on the life and health side,Iain Pearce,unknown
"We are quite optimistic thatwe are growing, but most of that will be -- and this is where our focus is on the bottomline, it's not on the top line",Iain Pearce,present
"Top line happened every now and then, and you have tounderstand there are basically three ways to grow the top line here.On the -- either we really write new large blocks of business, that will increase top line ormost of our treaties on the mortality side -- morbidity side are via treaties, and as thesetreaties get older, that mortality rates, morbidity rates grow exponentially",Iain Pearce,past
"So, the riskpremium grows, even if nothing happens, even if no new policies are added, thesetreaties grow for the existing portfolio, because we have risk premiums, which aregrowing.Of course, at some point in time, this goes the other way, because in 50 years all thesetreaties have runoff",Iain Pearce,past
"But as long as they are still young, 10, 15, sorry -- 10, 15 years old.These treaties are growing",Iain Pearce,past
"And then, of course, we have treaties, which are open fornew business, and this is another source of growth",Iain Pearce,past
"So, in general, we expect to reach the5% maybe a little bit more, but this mainly depends on large block transactions, especiallyon one of our focus areas",Iain Pearce,past
"And that is longevity.Then your question on the retro, yes, it kicks in at 110% population mortality",Iain Pearce,past
"And that isthe, as mentioned earlier by Clemens, it's a weighted average of the U.S., UK, andAustralian population mortality, weighted with the portfolio of Hannover Re.So, we try to get the correlation between this parametric cover and the results in our ownportfolio as high as possible",Iain Pearce,past
"So, we tried to optimize that by using our own portfoliostructure to define the parametric cover",Iain Pearce,past
"And as I said earlier, it's currently stands close to113%, according to our own calculations.And then, the longevity release, yes, we are, when we started 15, 20 years ago, we havelongevity and nobody else was doing that",Iain Pearce,past
We embarked on a pretty conservative way ofaccounting for that,Iain Pearce,past
"So, in the first couple of years and this is still valid today, we only showabout 2% to 3% profit in terms of an EBIT margin",Iain Pearce,past
"And if the portfolio develops asexpected, we would see and you've seen that now a release of these PADs especiallywhen we do these cleanup of portfolio",Iain Pearce,past
"With COVID, especially in the U.K., we got the -U.K",Iain Pearce,past
"is the largest market, we had a lot of claims and most of these claims have not beenaccounted for fully, because the release you have seen probably only includes theupdated portfolio information 12 months ago",Iain Pearce,past
"So, an awful lot of COVID is still not in there.That is something what we hope to release sometime in the future as soon as we knowthat we have valid data for that from the clients.Jean-Jacques HenchozOn P&C growth, Sven, do you want to add?Sven AlthoffYes",Iain Pearce,past
"As I said earlier, the increase in the major loss budget is not a good proxy for ourexpected growth in net earned premium on the P&C side next year",Iain Pearce,past
"From a process pointof view, we are fixing the major loss budget in the autumn of the previous year, so like weare doing now",Iain Pearce,past
"So, the EUR1.3 billion is fixed for 2022",Iain Pearce,past
"Same, of course, goes for the EUR1.1billion we fixed for 2021",Iain Pearce,past
"And we -- when we were fixing it at the time, we did not expect apremium growth of about 14% after three quarters on the P&C side, but we were moreexpecting a growth in the 5% to 7.5% range",Iain Pearce,past
"So, a good part of the increase in the majorloss budget is explained by catching up with the actual growth, which we have achieved in2021, plus then the expected growth for 2022.As Jean-Jacques said for 2022, we are expecting a more pronounced growth than the 5%on the P&C side",Iain Pearce,past
"But you should think more along the lines of the mid-term average Igave you during the Investors Day, i.e., the at least 7% number I gave you a few weeksago, rather than the 14% after three quarters",Iain Pearce,past
"By the way, the growth number will comeslightly back more to what the 10% growth number on the P&C side on the -- for the fullyear",Iain Pearce,past
"The reason why the growth rate in the third quarter was particularly high, reset onour biggest structured contract, we have increased our share",Iain Pearce,past
"So, there was a significantpremium entry booked in the third quarter",Iain Pearce,past
"But under that contract, we every year toohave the appropriate premium distribution on an earned basis and written basis, there willbe a significant number of premium booked out in the fourth quarter in 2022 on thatparticular contract",Iain Pearce,past
"And that's why the final number for P&C will be closer to the 10%rather than staying at the 14.5%, where we are after three quarters.Perfect",Iain Pearce,present
Thank you.OperatorThe next question is from Darius Satkauskas of KBW,Iain Pearce,past
Your line is now open,Iain Pearce,past
Please goahead.,Iain Pearce,unknown
Good morning,Darius Satkauskas,unknown
Thank you for taking my questions,Darius Satkauskas,past
"So, your Solvency II ratio have declined11 percentage points since the end of July",Darius Satkauskas,past
"Could you tell us how many Solvency II pointsdid the expected growth account for? And then, is this capturing the next 12 months? So,the 4Q 2022 as well or -- sorry, is it capturing the next 12 months or the entire 2022?And then lastly, do you have a comparable figure for last year, because if I look at theSolvency II decline in 3Q 2020 relative to 1H '20, it's much less pronounced",Darius Satkauskas,past
"So, yes, couldyou give us a comparable figure if possible? Thank you.Clemens Jungsthof elYes",Darius Satkauskas,past
"On Solvency II, it's actually the business growth that we've seen in 2021, that isreflected",Darius Satkauskas,past
"So, we've updated our model for the current business growth, which has beensignificant so far and also it includes the full 12 months of 2022",Darius Satkauskas,past
"So, that's really the usualplanning cycle that we complete in Q3, and then we include that in our SCR calculation forthe full year 2022, so that's the new business both in P&C and in life and health",Darius Satkauskas,past
"So thatincreases -- and then, of course, the higher capacities here and there in P&C and life andhealth",Darius Satkauskas,unknown
"So that's the main driver.I don't have the exact number, but it's going to be a double-digit number, which has beenoffset by some other effects, but I think it's about a double-digit number here",Darius Satkauskas,past
"And again,another contributor was, of course, the asset risk due to our slightly changed assetallocation and the increase in alternative investments as mentioned earlier",Darius Satkauskas,past
"That wasanother contributor.Thank you.OperatorAnd we have a follow-up question from Vinit Malhotra, Mediobanca",Darius Satkauskas,past
Your line is now openagain.,Darius Satkauskas,past

0,"Three quick questions. One is just a follow-up on your last answer. I don't understand thenwhy the diversification benefit on page 84 has gone up 51%, if you reduced thediversification to how come the overall, and as a proportion of the gross capitalrequirement gone up, I think from 32% to 36%, so?Okay. And the two other quick questions. If I look at your life reinsurance business andyour MCEV disclosure over the last five years, there's been just short of €800 million ofnegative operating variances or assumption changes related to U.S., UK, longevity,Australian DII. You continue to express a lot of confidence in the Life result improving, andalso in your EV translating to IFRS profits. It's a bit hard for us to kind of see that, given theamount of sort of assumption changes and variances that have been going through. Somaybe do you think you need to do a more thorough kind of ground-up review again ofassumptions? Or we've really passed the worst on particularly the U.S.? I still find it hard toget comfortable with the outlook there.The only other question I have, I think the implication is that you booked the unusedbudget on large losses. Is that how you want us to think about, Roland, as in the €200roughly-million of unused? And hence that's what's driving the sort of slight increase inreserve buffer again? Thanks."
